            My vacation period was very peaceful. I was practically the whole time at my girlfriend's house. We watched series, movies, we went out almost every day for dinner, we walked with the dogs, we cooked together, it was really nice! We also went to the gym every day, as well as starting to practice a new sport, beach tennis, it was a very good experience and we will continue to practice. We saw a lot of tiktok and also got a lot of sleep. I think we just needed to go to the beach haha.

            Itapema is a coastal city in the state of Santa Catarina known for its beaches with crystalline waters and beautiful landscapes. I was able to enjoy 3 days in this beautiful city. There were days with lots of sun and beach. There are many outdoor activities to do like biking, fishing, hiking.. Vacations in Itapema are perfect for those looking for a peaceful and relaxed beach destination, with beautiful scenery and lots of outdoor activities.

            A good way to enjoy your vacation is to go to the beach and relax.  I went to the Bombinhas beaches, good beaches for the family and with trails that depending on your body can fatigue you.  But the beaches are often calm and very clean, we have some beaches for boats and others for surfing, that is, there is entertainment for all tastes, including several places to eat.

            First of all, on vacation you should rest and spend time with family or friends. After that, playing sports and traveling are also cool ideas, anything that takes you out of your routine is a good idea. Catching up on reading, seeing if you've reached all of your goals for the year and setting new goals is something very interesting.

            During my vacation I spend with my parents at home, I spend the time that I had to relax and do things I would like to do, for example go out for a walking, reading a book, riding my bike, improving my drawings and watching movies and TV shows and take a time go to the movies. Itâ€™s been a long time since the last time that I went to the movies.
            I would have liked to have traveled to places with nature, but I enjoyed the time with my family because I am usually busy with studies and work and it w        </p>
